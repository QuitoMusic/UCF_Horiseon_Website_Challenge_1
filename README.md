# Horiseon Webpage Code Refactor for Accessibility Standards

## Description

In an everexpanding world of technology. Newer, more advanced features arise from research into user stories. This project is not the exception to this rule. As the human experience teaches us that there's a plethora of privileges provided for abled people, we have grown to understand that there's demand for newer technologies that adhere to empathetic standards.  

This project was built to maintain a solid, concise, and accessible code base that will povide the building blocks for Horiseon's website to function accurately, providing a comfortable experience for future developers and users alike.

As a former teacher, I found myself astonished to find there are so many ways of keeping a consolidated, correctly syntaxed code for the ends of accesibility and comfortability showing many ways of how languages through computing can achieve the same goal through a universe of layout ideas.
